    "We did it! Drawing GeoJSON files can require substantial computational effort, and so it might take a while for this code to run. Note that there are a few countries that are missing data, indicated by light gray. These correspond to cases in which there wasn't an entry of `march_avgs_by_country` matching the country name in the GeoJSON. This can occur either because there truly is no data or because there was a discrepancy inthe labels. In the latter case, we could improve the situation by data cleaning.  "
